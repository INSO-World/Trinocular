# Registry Service

## Description

The Registry Service manages visualization services. It plays a crucial role in Trinoculars
microservice and
micro-frontend architecture. It is responsible for managing (add, delete) visualization service
instances and providing
them to subscribers (pub/sub architecture).

Term clarification:

* Visualization Service: Container that offers one or many visualizations
* Visualization Group: Groups one or many Visualization Services together

## Dockerfile

- The Dockerfile sets up the environment for the Registry Service.
  - Load required modules
  - Copy the source code
  - Expose the port

[//]: # (## Service Instance Management)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (The Registry Service allows for the management of service instances, including health checks and notifications.)

[//]: # (Additionally, Subscribers can subscribe to notifications to retrieve all available visualizations.)

## Endpoints

All endpoints are API secured.

### `GET` /service/:name

Retrieve the details of a visualization group.

#### Path parameters:

- `name` Name of the visualization group

#### Response Body:

Array of visualization service data, containing:

```json
  {
  "0": {
    "hostname": "example.com",
    "healthCheck": "/health",
    "data": {}
  },
  "1": {
    "hostname": "example.com",
    "healthCheck": "/health",
    "data": {}
  }
}
```

* id: ID of the visualization service in the visualization group (used in following endpoints as :id
  parameter)
* hostname: Hostname of the visualization service
* healthCheck: Health check endpoint of visualization service
* data: Containing information about the concrete visualizations

`````json
{
  "visualizations": [
    {
      "name": "demo-apples",
      "displayName": "Demo - Apples",

  ]
}
````` 

#### Response Codes

* 404: Visualization service not found
* 200: Visualization service found

### `POST` /service/:name

Add a new visualization service to the group. If the group is not existing it will be created.

Path parameters:
