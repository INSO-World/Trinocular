# Postgres

## Description

The postgres service is configured to set up a PostgreSQL database that other services
within the system can use. It provides a secure and robust platform for data storage and retrieval.

## Dockerfile

The postgres service has no dedicated dockerfile as it is directly defined in the docker compose.
The service is a regular NodeJS service with an AlpineLinux base image. The database credentials are
not hard-coded in the environment file for security reasons and are instead managed using
environment variables.
